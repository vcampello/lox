# TO-DO

- Error handling
    - [x] refactor all errors into something that's usable
    - [ ] ~implement the `Error` trait and refactor again (look at `Error::source`)~
    - [x] simplify error handling with the crate `thiserror`
- Go back to chapter 6 and implement the challenges
    - [ ] Turn conditionals into expressions instead of implementing ternaries
    - [ ] Implement the error productions
